    <h1>Abstract</h1>
	<article>
		<p class="text-justify">Traveling is a large growing business across all countries. Bus reservation system deals with maintenance of records of details of each passenger. It also includes maintenance of information like schedule and details of each bus.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">We observed the working of the Bus reservation system and after going through it, we get to know that there are many operations, which they have to do manually. It takes a lot of time and causing many errors while data entry. Due to this, sometimes a lot of problems occur and they were facing many disputes with customers. To solve the above problem, and further maintaining records of passenger details, seat availability, price per seat, bill generation and other things, we are offering this proposal of computerized reservation system.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">By using this application, we can reserve tickets from any part of the world, through telephone lines, via internet. This project provides and checks all sorts of constraints so that user does give only useful data and thus validation is done in an effective way.</p>

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<article>
		<p class="text-justify">The project is to computerize traveling company to manage data, so that all the transactions become fast and there should not be any error in transaction like calculation mistake, bill generation and other things. It replaces all the paper work. It keeps records of all bills also, giving to ensure 100% successful implementation of the computerized Bus reservation system.</p>
		<p class="text-justify">This reservation system has three modules. First module helps the customer to enquire the availability of seats in a particular bus at particular date. Second module helps him to reserve a ticket. Using third module he can cancel a reserved ticket.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>First module retrieves data from tables required for enquire.</li>
				<li>Second module inserts values into the tables on reservation.</li>
				<li>Third module deletes values into from the table on cancellation of tickets.</li>
			</ul>
		<p class="text-justify">As the application is hosted using IIS Server onto internet it can be accessed by many number of people concurrently.</p>

	<h1>System study</h1>
	<article>
		<p class="text-justify">System study aims at establishing requests for the system to be acquired, development and installed. It involves studying and analyzing the ways of an organization currently processing the data to produce information. Analyzing the problem thoroughly forms the vital part of the system study. In system analysis, prevailing situation of problem is carefully examined by breaking them into sub problems. Problematic areas are identified and information is collected. Data gathering is essential to any analysis of requests. It is necessary that this analysis familiarizes the designer with objectives, activities and the function of the organization in which the system is to be implemented.</p>
		<ol class="margin-top-5px">
		
			<li class="margin-bottom-15px"><h4>Study of existing system</h4>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Existing system is totally on book and thus a great amount of manual work has to be done. The amount of manual work increases exponentially with increase in services.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Needs a lot of working staff and extra attention on all the records.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>In existing system, there are various problems like keeping records of items, seats available, prices of per/seat and fixing bill generation on each bill.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Finding out details regarding any information is very difficult, as the user has to go through all the books manually.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Major problem was lack of security.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li class="margin-bottom-15px"><h4>Proposed system</h4>
				<p>The system is very simple in design and to implement. The system requires very low system resources and the system will work in almost all configurations. It has got following features:</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Needs a lot of working staff and extra attention on all the records.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Ensure data accuracy.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Records are efficiently maintained by DBMS.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>DBMS also provides security for the information.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Any person across the world, having internet can access this service.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Availability of seats can be enquired very easily.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Passengers can also cancel their tickets easily.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Minimum time needed for the various processing</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Better Service</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Minimum time required</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>This would help the corporation prepare and organize its schedules more efficiently on the basis of traffic demand.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li class="margin-bottom-15px"><h4>Introduction about the back end(SQL SERVER 2008)</h4>
				<p>This proposed software is going to be development using the latest technology from Microsoft called Microsoft .NET and it is the software that connects information, people, systems, and devices. It spans clients, servers, and developer tools, consists of:</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>The .NET Framework 3.0 used for building and running all kinds of software, including Web-based applications, smart client applications, Mobile applications etc.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>Development tools, such as Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2010, which provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for maximizing development productivity with the .NET Framework.</p>
			</li>
					
			<li class="margin-bottom-15px"><h4>Introduction about the back end(SQL SERVER 2008)</h4>
				<p>Microsoft SQL Server 2008 is comprehensive, integrated data management and analysis software that enables organizations to reliably manage mission-critical information and confidently run todayâ€™s increasingly complex business applications. SQL Server 2008 allows companies to gain greater insight from their business information and achieve faster results for a competitive advantage.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>SQL Server is the fastest growing Database and Business Intelligence vendor.</p>
				<p><span class="margin-right-10px">&#10003;</span>SQL Server is more secure than Oracle. Since July 2003 more than 100 critical Oracle database security vulnerabilities have been identified, compared to ZERO for SQL Server for that period.</p>

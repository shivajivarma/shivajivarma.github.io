Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.</p>

				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">H</span></strong>ey, this is my personal website, so I have to say something about myself. Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with.

				<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">I</span></strong> am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen; I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I like public noise in the stadium; I like the beautiful of  sea near my home. I like the flat green field near to my town. I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and comedy movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;">Last but not least, i like my "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Computer</span>" very much.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">T</span></strong>his is a brief introduction of myself. If you are interested in knowing more, read my <a href="http://www.shivajivarma.wordpress.com" target="_blank">Blog</a>. Do not expect too much, and keep your sense of humor.</p>

<h3>Lyrics</h3>
<p class=margin-bottom-10px>
	The snow glows white on the mountain tonight,<br/>
	not a footprint to be seen.<br/>
	A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the queen.<br/>
	The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.<br/>
	Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried.<br/>
	Don't let them in, don't let them see.<br/>
	Be the good girl you always have to be.<br/>
	Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know.<br/>
	Well, now they know!
</p>
<p class=margin-bottom-10px>
	Let it go, let it go!<br/>
	Can't hold it back any more.<br/>
	Let it go, let it go!<br/>
	Turn away and slam the door.<br/>
	I don't care what they're going to say.<br/>
	Let the storm rage on.<br/>
	The cold never bothered me anyway.
</p>
<p class=margin-bottom-10px>
	It's funny how some distance,<br/>
	makes everything seem small.<br/>
	And the fears that once controlled me, can't get to me at all<br/>
	It's time to see what I can do,<br/>
	to test the limits and break through.<br/>
	No right, no wrong, no rules for me.<br/>
	I'm free!
</p>
<p class=margin-bottom-10px>
	Let it go, let it go.<br/>
	I am one with the wind and sky.<br/>
	Let it go, let it go.<br/>
	You'll never see me cry.<br/>
	Here I'll stand, and here I'll stay.<br/>
	Let the storm rage on.
</p>
<p class=margin-bottom-10px>
	My power flurries through the air into the ground.<br/>
	My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br/>
	And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br/>
	I'm never going back; the past is in the past!
</p>
<p class=margin-bottom-10px>
	Let it go, let it go.<br/>
	And I'll rise like the break of dawn.<br/>
	Let it go, let it go<br/>
	That perfect girl is gone<br/>
	Here I stand, in the light of day.
</p>
<p class=margin-bottom-10px>
Let the storm rage on!<br/>
The cold never bothered me anyway...
</p>

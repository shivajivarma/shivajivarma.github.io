It’s a very simple and sometimes user-friendly alternative when you need to fit quite a bit of content into a small space, not unlike a tabs component.</p><p>An accordion is most commonly used in F.A.Q.’s where you have questions and answers. Which, if just displayed straight to the page could potentially become incredibly long, stopping users from actually wanting to read or finding the answer they’re looking for.</p><p>That is also another good argument for accordion components, it allows users to see the outline of the content at a glance. Imagine if you were browsing a F.A.Q. and had to scroll all the way down through 20 different section just to find your answer. It would be a nightmare. If you could just scroll through the titles with content temporarily hidden, then it would make for a much better experience.</p><h3>Implementation</h3><p>Click on the topic and witness the magic around.</p><html><head><style>.accordion{

I didn't want to be embarrassed, so I claimed that I had a lot of work to do. I said I could easily find a date even better than his if I wanted to. I also told him that his date was ugly. I achieved power to help me feel confident; however, I embarrassed my friend and his date.

This girl wishes she could have her own room and have a lot of stuff, but she can't have these things because her family doesn't have much money. Her family's income is pretty low because her father is old and doesn't go to work. Her sister is the only one who works. Because her family can't buy her the things she wants, she feels a lot of stress and gets angry sometimes. Once, she wanted a beautiful dress to wear to a sweetheart dance. She asked her sister for some money to buy the dress. She was disappointed because her sister didn't have money to give her. She sat in silence for a little while and then started yelling out loud. She said her friends got anything they wanted but she didn't. Then she felt sorry for herself and asked why she was born into a poor family. Not having money has caused this girl to think negatively about herself and her family.
